Q.
  Can I use Terrain Generator in a commercial project?

A.
  Terrain Generator is freeware and any content created by it is the sole
  property of the creator. As such any content created by TG may be
  distributed for both commercial and non-commercial purposes at the creators
  will. The only restriction as stated (I hope) in TG's readme is that the
  software itself my not be redistributed commercially or used to promote the
  distribution of a commercial product. (i.e. You can package it on a CD and
  then sell that CD.)


Q.
  How do I load textures into TG?

A.
  From the 'Tools' menu select 'Options' and navigate to the 'Packages' tab.
  The 'Add Package' button can be used to load Half-Life WAD3 texture packages
  and the 'Add Folder' can be used to load .bmp, .jpg, .tga and .wal textures
  from a folder on your hard drive. You must first start a terrain before you
  can access the tools menu.


Q.
  How can I move the camera in the 3D view?

A.
  To rotate the camera press and hold your right mouse button in the 3D view
  and move it around. To position the camera use your arrow or WASD keys.
